first four weeks:
* javascript & html/css will be covered separately
* JS will be the exercises listed below
* html/css will be the rest of FCC, curated JS 30's, and a good video series
    * we have to portion these out over the first four weeks

week 3
* The topics covered this week are intense.  each day can only do an overview, they will have to intentionally continue studying each topic independantly solution-design week.  
* for conditionals, recursion & iteration, we will demonstrate the entire solution creation process (defined by the repo templates) and it will be up to them to practice the preceding exercises to master the creation process
