branching point: app development or data science

(unsorted beyond here)

###  programs = state + functions
* mechanisms of state -> external (side-effects, context, pure/immutable) vs internal free variables (closure, binding?)
* programming paradigms
* collecting state and functions into programs 
* deeper into free variables: prototypal delegation, starter inheritance design patterns, deep js
* programmer's oath

### apps = programs + user interaction
* 3-layer handlers
* error handling
* event listeners
* basic dom ui's
* layers of logging: browser/event level, handler/user-interaction leve, app level
* basics of frameworking: use the provided closure-based micro-framework in 3-layer handlers
* https://github.com/elewa-academy/Fundamentals/tree/master/12-user-empathy


###  using the dom
* reusable ui components
* vdom in action

### vdom
* given two mapping & demapping functions:
      * dom -> pojo's
      * pojo's -> dom
* learn about trees, algorithms, data structures 
* all on the thread
* see such abstract stuff in a practical context

(here begins using a series of progressive frameworks to combine state & functions)


### frontend frameworks
* hyperapp

### async
* callbacks
* event loupe
* promises
* async strategy


### terminalling
* reading lodash
* cli's
* cross-env development
* build scripts


### final project (super-duper portfolio)
* hyperapp, build scripts, transpiling, api-as-backend (github's)
