### pure functional programming


### deep js
* free variables with this & closure
* inheritance & prototypes
* js puzzles


(here begins using a series of progressive frameworks to combine state & functions)

###  programs = state + functions
* mechanisms of state -> external (side-effects, context, pure/immutable) vs internal free variables (closure, binding?)
* programming paradigms
* collecting state and functions into programs 
* deeper into free variables: prototypal delegation, starter inheritance design patterns, deep js

### apps = programs + user interaction
* 3-layer handlers
* error handling
* event listeners
* basic dom ui's
* layers of logging: browser/event level, handler/user-interaction leve, app level
* basics of frameworking: use the provided closure-based micro-framework in 3-layer handlers
* https://github.com/elewa-academy/Fundamentals/tree/master/12-user-empathy

###  deep dom & using it
* trees & traversals
* intro to virtual dom
* the dom in deeps
* reusable ui components


### frontend frameworks
* hyperapp


### async
* callbacks
* event loupe
* promises
* apis

### terminalling
* reading lodash
* cli's
* cross-env development
* build scripts

### final project (super-duper portfolio)
* hyperapp, build scripts, transpiling, api-as-backend (github's)
